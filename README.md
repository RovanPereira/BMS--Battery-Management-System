# BMS- Battery Management System

BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

Battery management systems (BMS) are electronic control circuits that monitor and regulate the charging and discharging of batteries. The battery characteristics to be monitored include the detection of battery voltages, temperature, capacity, state of charge, Health of battery, power consumption, remaining operating time, charging cycles, Battery protection and some more characteristics.
The task of battery management systems is to ensure the optimal use of the residual energy present in a battery. BMS protect the batteries from deep discharging and over charging, which are results of extreme fast charge and extreme high discharge current which will affect the battery life. In the case of multi-cell batteries, the battery management system also provides a cell balancing function, to manage that different cell of battery.

Further enhancement:

1.	Changing the current sequential code into event driven code using interrupts.
2.	State of charge (SOC) implementation.
3.	State of health (SOH) implementation.
4.	Power modes.
5.	Geofencing.
6.	Geotargeting.
7.	Regenerative braking.
